# Composite

### Intention
```
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects 
uniformly.

```
### Applicability
Use the Composite pattern when
- a tree structure is needed to represent part-whole hierarchies
- we want to provide client a single interface to interact with
